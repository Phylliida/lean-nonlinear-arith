# BOARD — lean-nonlinear-arith

Risk-first ordering: nla-01..03 are the derisk spikes and come before any
infrastructure investment. Status: `todo` / `active` / `done` / `blocked` /
`dropped`. See DESIGN.md for architecture and the risk register.

## Derisk spikes (do first, in any order, all cheap relative to what they retire)

- **nla-00** `done` Repo + Lake scaffolding, mathlib v4.25.0 pin, library layout.
- **nla-01** `done` **S1 statement spike.** `Projection/S1Statement.lean`
  elaborates clean, first pass: psc chains defined as explicit Sylvester-minor
  determinants (mathlib has `resultant`/`sylvester` but no subresultants — ours
  to build), `ParamPoly k = Polynomial (MvPolynomial (Fin k) ℝ)`, conclusion
  packaged as a `Delineation` structure (continuous strictly-ordered root
  functions, constant membership). No mathlib gaps blocking the statement.
  Statement may still evolve during the nla-11 proof campaign.
- **nla-02** `done` **Root-counting spike (S2-lite).** `RootCounting/Spike.lean`,
  all proven, no sorries: generic sign-invariance-from-rootlessness (IVT
  contrapositive — the checker's cell-sign workhorse), unique-root isolation for
  a concrete polynomial (IVT + `strictMonoOn_of_deriv_pos`), and the Rolle-chain
  bound composing (`Polynomial.card_roots_le_derivative` exists in mathlib!).
  Verdict so far: per-instance counting looks viable without general Sturm;
  final call after higher-degree census specimens (keep nla-10 conditional).
- **nla-03** `done` (descoped by design decision 2026-07-24). The project is
  proof-first: we cover all cases by porting the equivalent of everything Z3
  does and proving containment — coverage never depends on which goal shapes
  are common, and build order follows Z3's own pipeline architecture, so the
  census shape distribution is not an input to anything. Kept as record only:
  `Corpus/Rational.lean` with 3 proven specimens as plain regression tests;
  `data/census-*.txt` as the historical experiment log. Dropped: mass
  transcription, baseline tables, second-crate census, v0 heuristic tactic.
- **nla-20** `done` (2026-07-24, RULES.md — 39 emission sites rowed, all
  proven or n/a-with-reason) **Rule-correspondence spec.** The early artifact the
  containment proof actually needs: a source-referenced table mapping every
  Z3 nla generator to its Lean lemma family — nla_basics_lemmas.cpp schemas,
  order, monotonicity, tangent, divisions, monomial bounds, one row per rule,
  with the C++ provenance and the corresponding lemma statement. This document
  is the "Z3 ⊆ calculus" half of the structural argument (checked by reading,
  not running) and the fidelity contract nla-04/05 are built against.

## L1 — saturation layer

- **nla-04** `done` (2026-07-24) Template lemma library:
  `Templates/{Basics,Order,Monotone,Tangent,Divisions,Intervals}.lean`, all
  sorry-free; RULES.md fully resolved (27 rows proven or n/a-with-reason,
  zero todo). L1's mathematical content is finished — nla-05..07 are
  metaprogramming over a fixed lemma kit.
- **nla-05** `active` Monomial bookkeeping (emonics port) + generator loop.
  **Slice 1 done (2026-07-24):** `Tactic/Saturate.lean` — `nla_saturate` v0
  proves the architecture end-to-end on 11 regression tests
  (`Tactic/SaturateTests.lean`): postorder monomial collection over ℤ,
  sign/zero/square generation from a fixed `sr_*` rule vocabulary, premises
  discharged by `assumption <|> omega` *inside the evolving goal context*
  (nested monomials feed outer premises), revert/generalize/intros
  abstraction, omega leaf. **Slice 2 done (same day):** mined-constant
  order/interval generation — `mineBounds` extracts literal bounds from
  hypotheses (strict ℤ bounds tightened by one), generators instantiate
  `sr_lb_mul`/`sr_ub_mul`/`sr_ub_neg_mul` plus the full corner-product
  Intervals templates; 17 tests green, ~300ms/goal. **Slices 3+4 done (same day):** ring_nf
  normalization front-end (doubles as commutative canonization — obsoletes
  most of the emonics port) + power monomials with decide-discharged
  parity side conditions + tangent-plane generation anchored at mined
  constants (four orientations, linear conclusions; closes the classic
  `1 ≤ x → 1 ≤ y → x + y ≤ xy + 1`). 29 tests green. Remaining:
  (a) multi-round saturation with a round bound (needed once generators
  emit facts about new products), (b) proportion/abs rules if Verus
  corpora need them, (c) div/mod atoms (omega already speaks ediv/emod —
  likely free), (d) the RULES-row coverage audit: walk the table and
  check each proven row has a generator or an explicit
  instantiation-time story.
  Original design sketch (2026-07-24):
  * *atom map*: `Expr ↦ atom id` for maximal non-arithmetic subterms; monomial
    = sorted multiset of atom ids + sign, canonized like `emonics.cpp`;
  * *state*: hypothesis set as linear atoms over the monomial-extended
    vocabulary + the defining equation per monomial variable;
  * *round*: each generator scans monomials, instantiates its RULES row
    (Lean lemma application via `mkAppM`, constants from hypotheses — NOT
    from a model in v0), adds conclusions as new hyps with proof terms;
  * *leaf*: after each round, try `omega` on the abstracted goal; success ⇒
    done, failure ⇒ next round; fixed generator order, no throttling,
    bounded rounds (default small; the containment statement is
    per-round-count, mirroring Z3's stratification);
  * *determinism*: no randomization, no model dependence in v0 — strictly
    more instances than any Z3 schedule at equal depth.
- **nla-06** `todo` Linear leaf. **v0 decision: omega IS the leaf** — after
  monomial abstraction (each monomial -> fresh variable) the per-round closure
  check is a linear-ℤ problem, exactly omega's domain; no simplex needed until
  we want *models* to guide generation (Z3-style model-based lemma selection).
  v1 (only if blind saturation proves too slow on real corpora): untrusted
  exact-rational simplex (~300 lines meta) for models + Farkas certificates
  via linear_combination.
- **nla-07** `todo` Gröbner layer via grind ring engine / linear_combination,
  unthrottled. Re-run nla-03 corpus; expect most multiplicative-equality
  specimens to close here.

## Kernel + kit

- **nla-08** `todo` Computational Q[x] kernel (untrusted): dense ops, gcd,
  square-free decomposition, psc chains. Benchmark on specimen polynomials
  (perf derisk).
- **nla-09** `todo` Real algebraic numbers as (poly, isolating interval), sign
  determination emitting nla-02-style certified claims.
- **nla-10** `todo` General Sturm theory — only if nla-02 says per-instance
  Rolle-chains don't suffice. AFP Sturm_Sequences as the map. Upstream-worthy.
- **nla-11** `todo` **S1 proof campaign.** The long pole; two independent
  tracks that join at final assembly:
  * *algebra track*: 11a resultant vanishing (Res(f,g)=0 <-> not coprime, via
    Sylvester kernel <-> Bezout; then common root over ℂ, descend to ℝ) —
    upstream-worthy on its own; 11b psc <-> gcd-degree correspondence
    (subresultant theory core, the biggest algebra piece);
  * *analysis track*: 11c continuous dependence of roots on parameters at
    constant degree (via Rouché in mathlib's complex analysis, or elementary
    compactness); 11d topological glue: constant count + continuity +
    connectedness => ordered continuous root functions (the Delineation).
- **nla-19** `todo` **Quadratic-complete checker (S1-free).** Sequencing
  insight: nlsat lowers root conditions to Thom sign encodings at degree <= 2
  (`mk_quadratic_root`), and the nla-02 lemmas (sign-from-rootlessness, IVT
  isolation) already discharge those plus cell-sign steps. A checker restricted
  to traces whose projection steps stay at degree <= 2 per variable needs NO
  S1 — and Verus goals are overwhelmingly per-variable degree <= 2. Build this
  first; full S1 (nla-11) only unlocks the deep tail. Converts the capstone
  from a cliff into a ramp.

## L2/L3 — nlsat

- **nla-12** `todo` nlsat search port (classic path of nlsat_solver.cpp /
  nlsat_explain.cpp; no levelwise). Emits traces in the 5-shape language
  (DESIGN.md section 2/L3) + integer branch splits.
- **nla-13** `todo` Trace checker: discharge shapes 4/5 by per-instance ring,
  shape 2 by degree dispatch (ineq / Thom / nla-09), shapes 1/3 by S1 + S2.
- **nla-14** `todo` Front-end tactic `nonlinear_arith`: Int -> Real relaxation,
  L1 then L2/L3 layering, hypothesis selection matching Verus query shape
  (context-free: only stated requires).

## Integration

- **nla-15** `todo` tactus closer wiring: emit `nonlinear_arith` for
  `by(nonlinear_arith)` sites. Toolchain already aligned (tactus/lean-project
  pins lean+mathlib v4.25.0, identical to ours; integration is a require line).
- **nla-16** `todo` Parity harness: run the full workspace nonlinear corpus
  through the tactic; compare against Z3 site-for-site; census-style report.
  Acceptance: no site that Z3 closes and we don't.

## Milestone ladder (proof-first)

- **M1** rule-correspondence spec + template lemma library built against it
  (nla-20, nla-04).
- **M2** L1 complete — bookkeeping, saturation loop, omega leaf, Gröbner
  layer; correspondence table fully covered (nla-05..07).
- **M3** quadratic-complete nlsat — degree-<=2 search + S1-free checker
  (nla-08, nla-09, nla-12 restricted, nla-19).
- **M4** S1 campaign, algebra + analysis tracks in parallel (nla-11, nla-10
  if needed).
- **M5** full checker + the containment argument written up end to end:
  per-rule fidelity (nla-20 table) + saturation completeness + RCF trace
  checking (nla-13, nla-14).
- **M6** tactus integration, then the single end-stage empirical pass:
  workspace parity harness as confirmation, not guide (nla-15, nla-16).

The guarantee is delivered by M5 on paper + kernel; M6's harness exists to
confirm budgets/performance (the one declared-empirical residue) and to catch
spec-fidelity mistakes in the correspondence table, not to define coverage.
